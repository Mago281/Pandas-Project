## Introduction

In this challenge, I will be creating and manipulating Pandas DataFrames to analyse school and standardised test data.

The PyCitySchools Jupyter Notebok and following excel files were provided for this challenge:

I used the sample solution called PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb  to review the desired format for this assignment.

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I created a report that include the following data and included a written description of two observable trends based on the data.

Applying Python Pandas into analysis via Jupyter Notebook.
Objective & Overview
I am the new Chief Data Scientist for my local government area.  I have been tasked to analyse the area-wide standardised test results, for maths and reading, to assist the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
The raw data given included every student’s math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attended.  The final report includes each of the following:
•	District Summary
•	School Summary
•	Top 5 Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
•	Bottom 5 Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
•	Scores by Grade (9th to 12th)
o	Math scores
o	Reading scores
•	Scores by different categories
o	School Spending
o	School Size
o	School Type
•	Analysis
